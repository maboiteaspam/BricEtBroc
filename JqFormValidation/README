A PHP comopnent to handle form's valdiation

Inspired by http://code.google.com/p/jquery-validation-php-plugin/
Using http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation 

Require php5.3
Require Jquery to handle client side validation
Require GD for image upload

Aim's to be fast and simple to use, 
    to connect to any other component (thinking to ORM / MVC)
    to use directly without any kind of FrameWork

Provides common validator (required, min|maxlength, min|maxcount, email, url, file upload, image upload, remote|ajax, regex, callback)
Provides common dependency (checked, selected, notblank, blank)

Provide way to add validator for both PHP/JS side's 
Provide way to add more complex dependency for both PHP/JS side's

Need's examples ? Have look in 
    /html_tests/
    /php_tests/
    
Wnat's to know what is missing ? Have look on 
    /TODO
